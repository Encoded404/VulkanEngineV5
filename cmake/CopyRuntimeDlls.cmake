# Copies the MinGW/Windows runtime DLLs a built executable depends on into its
# output directory.
#
# Invoked as a script (cmake -P) once per executable from the POST_BUILD step
# in add_engine_example:
#
#   cmake -DDLL_DIRS=<dir>[;<dir>...] -DEXE=<exe> -DOBJDUMP=<tool>
#         [-DSTRIP=<tool>] -DDEST=<exe dir> -P CopyRuntimeDlls.cmake
#
# DLL_DIRS lists the directories that may hold those DLLs:
#   * <build>/vcpkg_installed/<triplet>/bin            (release dependencies)
#   * <build>/vcpkg_installed/<triplet>/debug/bin      (debug dependencies)
#   * <llvm-mingw>/<triple>/bin                        (libc++, libunwind, ...)
#
# When EXE and OBJDUMP are supplied, only DLLs in the executable's transitive
# import closure are deployed. Globbing the directories instead ships several
# megabytes the program never loads: the vcpkg bin directory also holds the
# gtest/gmock runtimes and the llvm-mingw one the sanitizer and OpenMP
# runtimes, none of which an example links (measured: 3.1 MB of 14 MB, 23%, on
# the RelWithDebInfo minimal example). The closure is read from the PE import
# tables, so a dependency that is only ever reached through LoadLibrary would
# need to be listed explicitly.
#
# STRIP, when set, strips each DLL right after it is copied. The vcpkg release
# DLLs ship with DWARF and a COFF symbol table, which is about a quarter of
# their size; exports live in a separate section and are unaffected (verified:
# identical export counts before and after stripping). Stripping is applied to
# every deployed DLL rather than only to ones copied here, because vcpkg's
# applocal step runs earlier in the same POST_BUILD command and may have put
# them in place already; stripping twice is a no-op.
#
# Files are only copied when missing or newer than the destination, so
# incremental builds do not re-copy unchanged DLLs.
#
# Run with -P, so no cmake_minimum_required from the surrounding project is in
# effect; state it here to get current policy defaults (notably CMP0057, the
# if() IN_LIST operator used below).
