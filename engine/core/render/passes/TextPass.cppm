// Screen-space text drawn over the scene as an engine-owned render pass.
//
// The pass is the integration point between the device-free text stack and the
// render graph: a caller queues shaped runs for a frame, the batch builder turns
// them into glyph instances, and Execute uploads those instances into the
// frame's per-FIF host-visible storage buffer and draws six vertices per glyph.
// There is no vertex buffer -- the quad corner comes from SV_VertexID and the
// per-glyph data from the instance buffer -- and the atlas page is sampled
// through the bindless array, so the pass owns no image.
//
// Setup declares a write on the backbuffer with auto_begin_rendering = false and
// load_op = eLoad, exactly like the ImGui overlay. The engine's executor only
// opens a dynamic-rendering scope around passes that ask for one, so like the
// overlay this pass opens its own scope for the glyph draw and loads the scene
// the main pass left behind rather than clearing it. The engine-owned pipeline
// is built with straight-alpha source-over blending (srcAlpha /
// oneMinusSrcAlpha for colour, one / oneMinusSrcAlpha for alpha), which is the
// correct composite for a non-premultiplied coverage value: the fragment emits
// the instance colour with the atlas's R8 coverage folded into alpha, and the
// destination shows through everywhere the coverage is partial.
//
// This is deliberately not a font manager: it holds no faces and no atlas. The
// caller supplies the rasterizer and the uploaded GlyphAtlasGpu per run; the
// engine-level TextSystem that owns them is a later commit.
