// The GPU side of a GlyphAtlas: one persistent page image per CPU page, each
// referenced by a stable bindless slot, plus the dirty-rect uploads that keep
// the image in step with the bitmaps.
//
// The split follows the atlas's own design. GlyphAtlas answers *where* a bitmap
// goes and *what changed*; it stores rectangles and never pixels. This class
// owns the other half: it creates a page image the first time the atlas has a
// page, hands out the bindless slot a shader samples, and copies each dirty
// region's bytes out of the rasterizer's bitmaps into that image.
//
// Pages are created with GpuTexture::CreateStream, the same persistent
// eTransferDst | eSampled image the physical-camera path uploads into: the page
// is written in place for the life of the atlas instead of being recreated per
// frame, and the sampled side is a single UNORM format with a linear sampler so
// the bilinear edge the atlas's padding gutter exists for works.
//
// One uploader design serves both text pipelines through a small seam. The page
// format chooses the image format (R8_UNORM for the FreeType coverage page,
// RGBA8_UNORM for the MSDF page) and how many bytes a texel costs, and a byte
// source resolves an atlas key to the bytes that belong in its rectangle. The
// existing SetGlyphSource A8 path is that seam with the default format: it wraps
// a RasterGlyph's coverage as the bytes. The MSDF pipeline calls SetPageFormat
// with Rgba8 and SetByteSource with a resolver that returns the generated four
// channels. The seam exists so there is exactly one uploader rather than two:
// page creation, page growth, whole-page recomposition after an eviction,
// precise dirty regions, staging retirement and frame-gated slot release all
// stay in one place, and only the format and the byte lookup differ. Duplicating
// that machinery for MSDF would be a second copy of the part most likely to rot.
//
// The format is a property of the uploader, not of one page: this class already
// tracks exactly one GlyphAtlas, and the A8 and MSDF pipelines keep separate
// atlases anyway (different key spaces and different cache owners), so each of
// them owns its own uploader. Two formats in one instance would make the byte
// stride ambiguous for no gain.
//
// SetPageFormat must be called before the first page is created (Initialize is
// not a page creation, but the first EnsurePages/UploadDirty is): a page image's
// format is fixed at creation and cannot be changed by the uploader afterwards.
//
// Lifetime mirrors the bindless manager's own rules rather than adding a second
// release path. A page that the atlas has dropped (Reset()) is released through
// BindlessManager::ReleaseSlot(handle, recording_frame), which keeps the
// descriptor valid until the FIF-drain proves no recorded frame can still
// sample it -- exactly the discipline TextureReloader and TextureResidency use
// for a slot swap. Nothing here calls ReleaseSlotImmediate.
