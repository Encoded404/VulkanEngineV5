// The GPU side of the hb-gpu blob store: one persistent storage buffer holding
// every encoded glyph blob, addressed by 8-byte unit offset from the shaders.
//
// The split mirrors GlyphAtlasGpu's: the pure part (BlobRangeAllocator, the
// encoder) decides *what* bytes go where and owns no device state, and this
// class owns the buffer they land in. Unlike the atlas there is no image, no
// bindless slot and no page: the blobs are one flat storage buffer, and a
// shader reads a glyph's blob by adding the instance's flat offsets to the
// buffer base.
//
// Growth never mutates or frees a buffer an in-flight frame could still read.
// When the packed blobs no longer fit, a new, larger GpuBuffer is created, the
// whole shadow image is re-uploaded into it, and the old buffer is enqueued into
// the engine's FrameRing retire path, which destroys it one full frame-in-flight
// cycle later -- the same ring-drain discipline GpuImageHeap and the bindless
// manager use, not a second release path. The descriptor the pass binds is the
// *current* buffer, so a frame that already recorded against the old one keeps
// reading a live buffer for its whole lifetime.
//
// The buffer is host-visible and coherent: blobs are appended a few glyphs at a
// time as text is first seen, and a mapped copy is the cheapest way to publish
// them. Nothing here rewrites bytes a frame might still be reading except
// through the growth path above, because an existing blob's offset never moves.
//
// Not thread-safe; the text system that owns one serializes submission.
