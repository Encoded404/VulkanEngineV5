// How FreeType is asked to fit an outline to the pixel grid.
//
// Hinting is the reason this rasterizer exists at all: an unhinted outline at
// 11 px is a blurry approximation of the shape, and a UI that draws at small
// sizes needs the stems snapped to whole pixels. FreeType offers two ways to
// get there, and the difference is real:
//
//   * Native runs the font's own hinting programs. It is the best result when
//     the font ships them, and nothing at all when it does not -- many webfonts
//     (the vendored Lato included) carry no TrueType instructions.
//   * Light runs the auto-hinter in its light mode, which works on any outline
//     source and only nudges edges instead of force-snapping every stem, so it
//     keeps the font's proportions at the sizes the UI actually uses.
//
// Light is the default for exactly that reason: it is never absent and never as
// distorted as the normal auto-hinter, while Native stays available for a font
// known to be well hinted.

// Snaps a requested pixel size to the nearest 1/8 px.
//
// A DPI-scaled UI asks for continuously varying sizes -- a 1.25 scale turns
// 14 px into 17.5, an animation can hand over any float at all -- and a cache
// keyed on the raw float would hold a separate bitmap for every value that
// happens to be requested, growing without bound for no visible difference.
// Eighth-pixel steps are finer than the hinting grid (whole pixels) and finer
// than anything a display can show, so quantizing costs nothing visible and
// bounds the number of distinct sizes a cache can see. Zero (and anything
// non-positive) stays zero, which callers use as "do not rasterize".

// and no colour -- the value is coverage, so 0 is fully transparent and 255
// fully opaque.
//
// `left` and `top` place the bitmap relative to the pen origin in the usual
// y-down bitmap sense: the pen sits at (0, 0), +x grows right and +y grows
// *down*, so the bitmap's top-left pixel is drawn at (pen_x + left, pen_y + top)
// and `top` is negative for ink that sits above the baseline. For example 'H'
// at 24 px has a positive `left` (it starts inside its advance) and a `top`
// around -17. The y-down sign is deliberate: the same numbers can be added
// straight to a top-left-origin layout without a flip. It is the negation of
// FreeType's `bitmap_top`, and therefore the negation of the y-up
// GlyphMetrics::bearing_y the shaping side reports.

//
// FreeType's own documentation is explicit that an FT_Face is not safe to use
// concurrently -- it carries the size, transform, and glyph slot that a load
// mutates -- and that the documented pattern is one FT_Library per thread.
// `thread_local` is the obvious spelling of that and is the wrong one here: the
// global ThreadPool outlives and joins its workers, and a thread_local FT_Library
// destructor would then run during engine teardown while the pool may still be
// running a job, and on a thread the engine does not own. Worse, a worker that
// has gone idle would keep its library and every face it ever parsed alive for
// the life of that thread, with no way to bound or clear them.
//
// An explicit pool makes the lifetime the engine's: slots are created up front,
// a rasterization job acquires one slot and holds it for its whole duration, and
// teardown destroys the faces and libraries in a known order on a known thread.
// The pool is safe to call from any number of threads; when every slot is busy,
// Acquire() waits rather than creating a library on demand.
//
// FT_Faces are cached per slot, keyed by the font's byte buffer identity and its
// face index, so a font is parsed once per worker instead of once per glyph. The
// entry also holds a shared_ptr to the FontFace, which is what keeps the sfnt
// bytes alive for as long as a cached face points into them -- keying on the
// buffer address without owning it would let a destroyed face's address be
// handed to a different font, the same reuse hazard the shaping cache key
// exists to avoid.
