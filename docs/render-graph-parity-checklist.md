# Render-graph manual parity checklist

Complements the automated gates (device-free unit tests, golden `BarrierPlan`
snapshot, and the device-gated offscreen frame hash). Run this by hand after any
change that touches graph compilation, barrier planning, resource aliasing, or
the pass dispatch path. Automated tests catch determinism and hashes; this list
covers the things a human notices.

Run the reference scene with validation layers and watch the log:

```bash
./build/bin/basic_scene --validation
```

1. **Startup** — no validation errors or warnings during instance/device/swapchain
   creation; all shaders/pipelines compile first try.
2. **Steady state** — no per-frame validation messages (especially synchronization
   VUIDs) once the first frames have passed.
3. **Resize** — drag-resize the window; no `VUID-vkQueuePresentKHR`, no out-of-date
   storm, no leaked swapchain images; the image returns to a correct frame.
4. **Minimize / restore** — zero-size framebuffer is handled (no crash, no
   validation error), rendering resumes on restore.
5. **Hot reload** — edit a shader; the engine reloads it without a validation
   error and the change appears/behaves as expected.
6. **Add/remove an app pass at runtime** — insert a custom pass, confirm it runs
   in the expected slot, remove it, confirm the remaining frames are still correct.
7. **Visual correctness** — compare against the previous build: geometry, culling,
   occlusion, and post effects are pixel-equivalent (no flicker, no dark/blank
   frames after a graph mutation).
8. **Clean shutdown** — no validation errors on teardown; device drains before
   resources are freed.
9. **GPU counters (optional)** — capture with RenderDoc or a vendor tool: check
   that barrier counts and layouts did not regress unexpectedly, and that alias
   reuse actually happens for the resources intended to alias.
